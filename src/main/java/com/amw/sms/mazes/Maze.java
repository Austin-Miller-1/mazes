/**
 * High-level class representing a maze. Mazes consist of a grid of cells and 
 * optionally an entrance and exit. This means that mazes can be built as solvable or
 * unsolvable. 
 * A solvable maze is one with an entrance and exit such that at least one path exists between
 * the entrance and exit.
 * An unsolvable maze is one without entrances OR one that has entrances for which no path exists between them.
 * A solvable maze can be made insolvable and vice versa by setting its entrances at runtime.
 * 
 * Mazes should not be created directly using this class and should instead be built using the MazeBuilder class. 
 * TODO - if that's the case, then Maze should be made an innerclass and follow the builder pattern more standardly, right?
 * @see MazeBuilder
