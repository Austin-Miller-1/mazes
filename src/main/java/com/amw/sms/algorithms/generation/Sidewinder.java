/**
 * Sidewinder maze-generation algorithm.
 * 
 * The Sidewinder algorithm can be updated to generate a maze towards a specific direction,
 * that is, such that it's biases end up in that direction. These two factors control this directional bias:
 * 1. Whether the algorithm iterates through rows versus columns.
 * 2. The direction it chooses to open the run at when the run is closed.
 * 
 * Iterating via rows will cause a north/south directional bias.
 * Iterating via columns will cause a east/west directional bias.
 * 
 * The second factor determines which of the two directions it goes in.
 * 
 * Another way of changing the bias is simply rotating the grid itself in a certain direction. This would allow
 * for a single implementation of the central algorithm (instead of one that account for all 4 directions), 
 * and instead, handle the directional change via redirection through a grid-rotation algorithm. 
 *
